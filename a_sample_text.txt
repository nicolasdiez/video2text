Over the course of 2024, Warren Buffett, the world's best investor, has been building up a massive pile of cash—the likes of which investors have never seen before—$325 billion to be exact. What's even more concerning is his language around why he's doing it.

"But I don't mind it at all under current conditions—building the cash position. I think when I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive."

Over the past year or so, a massive discussion topic in the value investing community has been the lack of opportunities in the market and the accumulation of cash in preparation for some sort of rough weather ahead.

So, in this video, I don't want to get doom and gloom on you, but I do want to talk about the probability of a stock market correction and how you should best prepare yourself—the Warren Buffett way. No speculation, just logical, well-reasoned strategies.

So, what even is a stock market correction? A market correction is a decline in the price of a stock or group of stocks, typically defined as a drop of 10% or more from a recent high.

It's worth noting that corrections are a normal part of market cycles and can occur in response to various factors, including economic conditions such as interest rate movements, external events such as the coronavirus or wars, or simply changes in investor sentiment—where investors en masse start feeling more bearish about the future.

Corrections can happen to an individual stock—say Tesla or Nvidia—you can see each of those stocks suffering multiple corrections across the past year. You can also see a correction across a sector or industry. For example, in July and early August this year, we saw a correction in the NASDAQ—a list of predominantly technology-based businesses in the US.

And, of course, finally, you can see a correction in the overall market itself as investor sentiment changes. Take the start of 2022 as an example—that was when inflation crept up very high, and the Fed started signaling that they were going to raise interest rates.

Beyond stock market corrections, you might have also heard people talking about bear markets—and they’re really just a sustained period of falling prices. The internet will tell you that it's when you see a 20+% decline in prices, but it's really just when there's a serious change in sentiment leading to a prolonged period of market weakness.

For example, while the market did correct at the start of 2022 based on the announcement that the Fed was going to flip monetary policy and raise rates, that initial correction eventually went on to form part of a wider bear market across the whole of 2022—as investors had to deal with a flurry of interest rate hikes and vastly different economic conditions.

For stock market corrections, you're looking at more days or weeks, whereas for a bear market, you're looking at months or potentially years.

So, those are the definitions and differences. But now, I wanted to talk about the probabilities of us actually seeing a stock market correction anytime soon.

As I mentioned at the top of the video, a lot of very smart value investors are building up piles of cash to prepare for turbulent times ahead. So, where are we at the moment?

Well, it's no secret that the US stock market is pretty darn overvalued at a Shiller P/E ratio of 37. When you break it down further and look at all the big companies in the S&P 500, it's true that their valuations are seriously stretched.

A lot of people will say that the stock market at all-time highs means there's a correction on the horizon. But actually, that is not true at all. Occasionally—very occasionally—overvaluation can cause the prices of individual stocks to correct. But it's typically not a deciding factor as to whether the stock market more broadly dives into a correction.

There's a great quote from John Maynard Keynes that says, "The stock market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent." And that is very true. Markets can stay overvalued for a very, very long time—so much so that it is a really bad strategy to bet on a market downfall based simply on irrationality happening in the market.

Just trying to time the market doesn’t work. This is Warren Buffett explaining this point way back in 2001:

"Things can go on a long time that don't make sense, but they do come to an end. Herb Stein one time said, 'Anything that can't go on forever will end.'"

And usually, it's some form of catalyst that ends things.

For an individual company, this might be an earnings report or a market announcement. For an industry, it might be a new regulation or an external event—think travel companies during COVID times.

For the broader market, usually it's external factors affecting the economy—such as the outbreak of war, a change in the macroeconomic environment, for example, interest rate hikes, or just a broad change in investor sentiment based on economic data like GDP growth, productivity, consumer spending, or earnings reports across the S&P 500.

Lots of different things—but usually, overvaluation alone doesn't make the market correct. In most instances, there is a catalyst for it.

So, the next question is—are there potential catalysts on the horizon today?

And the answer is—well, yes. That doesn’t mean they’ll eventuate into any sort of correction, but there are very many potential catalysts looming on the horizon as we speak.

One obvious one in recent times is the US election. A change in power, a change in policies, a change in direction—can cause shakiness in the stock market.

Beyond politics, there’s ongoing concern about persistent inflation and long-term inflationary forces. If the Federal Reserve saw another inflation spike and signaled the potential for further interest rate hikes—that could very well be a catalyst for market weakness.

There's also a lot of discussion around China and Russia moving to diversify away from the US dollar. If trade tensions or tariffs escalate, that could very well shake investor confidence, leading to a correction.

There are major wars occurring in Ukraine and the Middle East.
That the United States is kind of indirectly involved in any escalations—there could definitely shake investor sentiment. There’s concern that the US economy might fall into a recession. There are ongoing concerns around the debt ceiling and the growing deficit. There’s the ongoing slate of economic data releases for things like GDP growth, employment, consumer confidence, etc.—all of that stuff can weigh on investor sentiment.

There’s a lot going on right now that could potentially have a negative impact on markets. And going back to Warren Buffett’s words around wanting to hold more cash:

"With all that’s going on in the world right now…"

This isn’t him predicting that a correction is on the horizon—he’s simply saying that right now, there are a lot of potential catalysts that could kick things off. So he’s making sure he’s prepared for any outcome.

And that kind of perfectly leads us to the third part of the video, which is: how do we prepare for a stock market correction? And also—should we prepare for one?

As I was just saying, it’s a fool’s errand to try and time the market. So is Warren Buffett going against his own best practices here?

Well, it kind of depends on how you think as an investor. You know, some investors are very comfortable admitting that they don’t know how to pick the winners, and they don’t know when the winning times will be. And if that’s you, it pays to be constantly invested and diversified across the broader market.

Sure, the stock market might correct, but you’ll do far better just riding the ups and downs over a long period of time. So the first step in preparing for a stock market correction can just be diversification and a long-term mindset.

But then, what if you are someone that builds their portfolio through individual stock selection? Someone that follows the Warren Buffett style approach?

Well, in that case, building up cash reserves can be a very good idea—to take advantage of those very infrequent moments where you do get sudden discounts in the market.

Now, there is nuance to this, because I will admit, this does start to sound like you’re timing the market, which is a notoriously bad strategy. But that’s not exactly the case.

What you’re actually doing is simply following a tried and true strategy: looking to buy great businesses at fair prices. And in times like this, it’s naturally very hard to find those opportunities. So we’re not trying to accumulate cash—but just by following that approach, that’s exactly what ends up happening.

This is exactly what’s happening to Warren Buffett right now. And it can be extremely beneficial to have cash on the sidelines during stock market corrections.

As I said, these are infrequent moments where you can buy low. Warren Buffett has even said in his 2016 shareholder letter:

"Every decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs—not teaspoons."

So we need to have at least some cash ready to take advantage of those infrequent opportunities that can really accelerate our annual returns.

Warren Buffett’s actually the perfect example—keeping cash on the sidelines enabled him to act in a big way during the 2008 meltdown. He invested $5 billion in Goldman Sachs at the height of the crisis. And in return, Berkshire Hathaway received preferred shares with a 10% dividend, plus warrants to buy additional Goldman shares at a set price.

So in the end, this netted Buffett a $3.1 billion profit—or 62% over five years. He bought $3 billion worth of General Electric preferred shares, which gave him a 10% annual dividend.

Later, in 2011, he invested $5 billion in Bank of America—that made him an absolute fortune.

Having that cash on hand to invest in those sudden moments where the market or a stock suddenly corrects can make a huge difference to your returns.

I mean, I can talk about this from personal experience with my own stock portfolio.

Back when the pandemic hit and the market dropped 30% in the space of three or four weeks, I remember staying up one night talking to my friend Hieish the day before the Fed came in and said they were going to rescue the economy.

I remember buying both Google and Meta shares that night. And if we zoom out today—that turned out to be a very handy decision.

But what would the result have been if I hadn’t had my cash ready to go that night? If I had missed the sudden drop in both of those businesses?

My Meta return would be 67% instead of 282%. And my Google return would be 124% instead of 211%.

So these corrections or crashes really do make a substantial difference for long-term-minded value investors. They really lift your returns in the long run.

Investors behave in very human ways—which is: they get very excited during bull markets. And when they look in the rearview mirror and see a lot of money having been made in the last few years, they plow in, and they just push and push and push prices higher.

And when they look in the rearview mirror and see no money having been made, they just say, “This is a lousy place to be.”

So they don’t care what’s going on in the underlying business—and it’s astounding. But that makes for a huge opportunity—just a huge opportunity.

Having cash on hand is the first thing you need. But another very important point in this conversation is also making sure you’re ready to deploy that cash.

This comes back to keeping on top of your research. And I think this affects a lot of people.

When the markets are falling, it’s kind of interesting to do the research and stay up to date with your watchlist. But a lot of people—including myself—will find it a lot harder to stay motivated to do the work when everything is expensive and not even close to consideration for a potential investment.

I get it—it’s like banging your head into a brick wall.

But remember Charlie Munger’s saying:

"99% of… great investing is in the waiting." 

What we need to do is stay really up to date with our watchlist during that 99% of the time so that when the 1% inevitably happens, we're already ready to go.

Things you won't believe in your lifetime—and securities markets and the country—will do very well over time. But you will see these huge waves, and if you can stay objective throughout that, if you can detach yourself temperamentally from the crowd, you get very rich.

So, stay on top of the earnings reports, stay on top of the conference calls, stay on top of the valuations—and then if you do have some cash set aside, you can really benefit when those corrections come along.

So, in summary, I think—yes—like what Warren says, there are plenty of catalysts today that may trigger a correction in a very overvalued stock market. But as Warren is doing, instead of betting heavily on it happening, we should instead look ahead as we always do, with a small amount of cash on the sidelines to take advantage if something were to occur.

Remember—don't listen to the predictions and the commentary that you see on CNBC or from talking heads like me on YouTube. I think we just need to stay focused on being in a position where we can capitalize if something were to go bang.
